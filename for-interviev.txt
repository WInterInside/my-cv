Okay, let’s start. My name is Maksim, and although I am already 30 years old, cashiers in the store are still asking for my documents before selling alcohol. I live in Crimea, in small village near Alushta. 
I’m married and have douther, she’s 2 years old. 

In 2012 graduated from the Taurida National University named after V. I. Vernadsky in the specialty "Computer Sysems and Networks", but, frankly, little interest in this area.
In 2018 I took a training program at CSS and HTML in HTMLacademy.ru. 
My professional experience includes just few small projects wich I made.
As for my personal qualities, I want to mention only the incredible stress resistance, sociability and open-minded.

I have some hobbies, one of them is to write small poems or lyrics at leisure, try to perform them, writing in mp3.
On this, perhaps, i can complete my short story.
